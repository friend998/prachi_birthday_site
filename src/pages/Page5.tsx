              That 16-year-old kid started to go to coaching on a regular basisâ€¦ made lots of friends for the first time, came out of his solitude. The guy who barely went to school, took dummy school to avoid people, started to go to allen //a place Traumatizing for most people//, started to hang out. Friends and all happened because he started to his dummy school (Allen),that kid, he went there on a regular basis.. just so after the classes...he could catch a glimpse of her. He was never significant for her to notice, tbh. He didn't ever understand what he was experiencing. Everything has a first time, guess so. He always slept through those awkard feelings, never spoke to this girlâ€”maybe only once he did speak hehe. The only thing he is to her is gratefull. <br></br>how that single glance at that time felt tbh(video) ðŸ‘‡
